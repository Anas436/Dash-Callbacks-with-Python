# Dash-Callbacks-with-Python





## Objectives
<div class="alert alert-block alert-info" >

After completing the lab you will be able to:

* Work with Dash Callbacks

## Theme

Extract average monthly arrival delay time and see how it changes over the year. Year range is from 2010 to 2020.

## Expected Output

Below is the expected result from the lab. Our dashboard application consists of three components:

*  Title of the application
*  Component to enter input year
*  Chart conveying the average monthly arrival delay

#### Airline Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance Dataset

The Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance Dataset contains information on approximately 200 million domestic US flights reported to the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The dataset contains basic information about each flight (such as date, time, departure airport, arrival airport) and, if applicable, the amount of time the flight was delayed and information about the reason for the delay. This dataset can be used to predict the likelihood of a flight arriving on time.
